## Hi there 👋

Hey! 👋 I'm Nano, a cybersecurity analyst specializing in pentesting and information gathering using OSINT techniques. My passion for cybersecurity began at the age of 12 when I started learning about various topics related to ethical hacking on my own. This led me to join different hacking and cybersecurity enthusiast communities. I have extensive knowledge as a Red Team member, and in my free time, I enjoy participating in CTFs that challenge my skills.
